# Day 5

Hello guys

How is this journey with C? Interesting?
We know,Each variable in C has an associated data type. Each data type requires different amounts of memory and also have different ranges upto which they can store numbers. So yes,we will be discussing on some topics we must know about datatypes. And they are👇🏻

1. Type modifiers

2. Type conversions
- Explicit

- Implicit

Go through these and understand the concept. Ask doubts if any.


## Task

Quiz time...

Hope you guys went through the tutorials.So lets take a small quiz based on todays topics

Link : https://forms.gle/N5WsPKtyvRJFnc5z7

1. Which is a valid typecast?
* a(char);
* char:a;
* (char)a;
* to(char,a);

2. Which conversion is not possible?
* int to float
* float to int
* char to float
* All are possible

3. What will be the data type of the result of the following operation?
- (float)a * (int)b / (long)c * (double)d	
4. When do you need to use type-conversions?
5. Predict the output
- float x = 0.1;        printf(""%d, "", x);        printf(""%f"", x);
6. What is the output?
- short int i = 20; char c = 97;        printf(""%d, %d, %d\n"", sizeof(i), sizeof(c));
7. Types of Real numbers in C are.?
* float
* double
* long double
* all the above

8. signed and unsigned representation is available for.?
* short,int,long,char
* float,double,long double
* both
* none
9. Which of the following is not a valid declaration in C? 
* short int x;
* signed short x;
* short x;
* unsigned short x;	
10. Which is correct with respect to the size of the datatypes? 
* char>int>float
* int>char>float
* char<int<double
* double>char>int
