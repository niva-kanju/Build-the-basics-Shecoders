Hi everyone,
Today also we will stick onto functions. Today we will see how recursions of function are implemented. 

Recursion ,as the name suggests, is a repetition of some procedure. In recursive function,the function calls itself.
Let's see the video instead of these narrations😅

Watch these videos and raise your queries if you are stuck anywhere between the logic.


After having a clear idea on how recursive function works try to do the following programs 👇

1. Write a recursive function to find sum of n natural numbers

Test case:

Enter numbers : 5

Output : 15

2. Define a recursive function to print the fibnocci series upto the limit entered 

Input :

Limit : 7

Output :

0 1 1 2 3 5 8

Raise any queries here if you are getting stuck at any point of time..so enjoy coding😉👍
