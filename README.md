## CONTEXT

After having the review meet with members of SHECODERS ,we have come to know that many of them got stuck and stopped doing daily task due to lack of coding idea.
So, we have taken some steps.
One among that is to form a Telegram group for providing basic programming idea.
Our basic motive behind this is to make them set to face coding problems.This group is for absolute beginners.

### Setting up the environment

Is there anyone without a lap and anyone that doesn't have an IDE set upped or don't know to code in terminal?
You can either use an IDE or terminal,online compilers are also available.
Try this one:
[GDB Online Debugger](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler)

Or you can setup and use different IDEs
