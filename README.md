## CONTEXT

After having the review meet with members of SHECODERS ,we have come to know that many of them got stuck and stopped doing daily task due to lack of coding idea.
So, we have taken some steps.
One among that is to form a Telegram group for providing basic programming idea.
Our basic motive behind this is to make them set to face coding problems.This group is for absolute beginners.


## STRUCTURE

Hi guys..so let's start by the next day
Our schedule will be like this

1.Tutorial links will be shared in the group @10:00AM every day.

2.We will conduct a Gmeet or will prepare videos of problem solving on important topics.
We will try to do it by ourselves.If such sessions are there,we will let you know by 3PM.
ie gmeet link or videos will be shared at that time.

3.There will be small daily  tasks or quizez.We can conduct it @7PM.
You can take your own time to think and find the answer but must start at that time .
And there will be a discussion after that . You can ask your doubts directly in the group.
You can ask at any time,but this time is official for doubt clearance

And Girls ,make sure that you spent time for this everyday.make sure that you take it seriously,so
Let's Build the Base


### Setting up the environment

Is there anyone without a lap and anyone that doesn't have an IDE set upped or don't know to code in terminal?
You can either use an IDE or terminal,online compilers are also available.
Try this one:
[GDB Online Debugger](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler)

Or you can setup and use different IDEs
