# Day 12

Hello all

Yesterday we were discussing  Strings. Today also we will continue with the same topic because you guys completed the string manipulation problems in main group without having a clear idea on it.So what we will see today might be already familiar for you. 

We are gonna give you same playlist we've made as solution for string manipulation. Here is the link. Do watch it slowly and clearly.

And guys ,as you suggest , today onwards we will provide you the tutorial and tasks together in the morning itself so you can complete it at anytime. Today's task will be here soon

## Task


Now you might have noticed how one dimensional as well as two dimensional arrays helps in traversing, splitting, combining strings , however string itself is a character array. Thus the concepts of arrays helps in generating most of the code over string.
Todays is a simple task comparing with the tutorial provided. And the task is to print all the words seperately within a string

Test case: 
					this is the input string

Expected output:

								this
								is
								the
								input 
								string
