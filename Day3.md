# Day 3


Hello girls
So now we know the method of doing arithmetic,relational and logic operations in C.
Hope that you have attended the last task too
Today we will see how some unary operators works.
Watch the videos and understand.

1. Increment & decrement  operators

3. Shift operators

Don't lose interest seeing the number of videos.Altogether it is about some 10minutes.
Feel free to ask your doubts after watching.



## Task

Today there is no task instead a small quiz of 10 questions..so everyone please attend the quiz on time...the link will be shared at sharp 7.00.

1.What value does the variable b have after ALL of the code executes?     int a;int b;a=2;b=2++;	
2. Which of the following operators has the highest precedence?	unary+ * >= ==
3.What will be output of the following C code?        int x=4, y, z;    y = --x;    z = x--;    printf(""%d, %d, %d\n"", x, y, z);
4. What is the output of Left Shift Operator << on (00011000<<2).?	
5. What is a Single Operand Operator below.?	
6.    int a = 5, b = -7, c = 0, d;        d = ++a && ++b || ++c;        printf(""\n%d%d%d%d"", a, b, c, d); What will be the output of the code?
7.   int a = 1;    int b = 1;    int c = a || --b;    Value of c
8. What is the output of Bitwise OR operation | on (0110 | 1100).?
9. Choose the correct statement about Left Shift Operator << .?	
10.   int a=0;    a = 5>2 ? printf(""4""): 3;    printf(""%d"",a);output ??"
