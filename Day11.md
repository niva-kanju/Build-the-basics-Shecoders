Good morning girls

Today we will be covering Strings in C. You've already completed the tasks on string manipulation.
String is actually a vast topic to discuss and we too were confused where to start this😅
So here is what we chose for you. This is actually a playlist.

Take a look at what you really don't know and you can skip the topics you are already familiar with.
Also there are some programs at the end of it . Try to watch that too even later because that will help you to know more and have a strong base of strings.

Feel free to raise your doubts here🙌🏻


 
After having a clear idea on working of strings in C , looks like you guys are ready to take up todays task and here is it👇
Write a program in C to compare two string without using string library functions. 

Test Data :
Input the 1st string : This is first string
Input the 2nd string : This is first string

Expected Output :

The length of both strings are equal and also both strings are equal.
