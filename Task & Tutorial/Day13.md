# Day 13


Good morning guys,

Hope all of you are going good.

After Strings it is time for us to move to the next topic. Today's tutorial is on Functions. All of you may have heard and used functions. So let's us discuss it in detail today.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. We will see User Defined functions in C today. That is you are going to define what the function should do.You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.

So here is the video . Go through it and try defining functions on your own

We would like to appreciate interest  shown by Jilna for her timely completion of tasks..good going dear

Jilna Anjima Anusree Shifa Sahla Aswathy Athira were those  who tries to complete the tasks..good job girls..complete the rest also and catch up those task you have missed


## Task

The function is an important part of a code with lots of advantages, it makes your code efficient and reliable. At times using functions makes our code simple, thus there is a need for you to get used to it, that is practice using functions.
So todays task is to check whether a number is palindrome or not . 
Nb: write a function ispalindrome() to check.
Take a number from the user call the function, check whether its palindrome or not and print it.

Test case :

	Enter the number: 101

Expected output :

	Its a palindrome number

Enjoy coding practice more on functions.
