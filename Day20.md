Good Morning all

Am so glad to tell you that we have covered almost all the topics we have listed to give you as part of this BUILD THE BASICS PROGRAM. Today I am here with our last topic Queue.

Queue is also a datastructure in C like stack. And they are almost similar . Queue is implemented as it models the real world queue.

Watch these two videos and raise your queries.

And guys please message here or ping me personally if we have missed any major topic we should cover. Or you can tell us if you have heard anything other than this and wish to know more about it.

Also,let us know if you feel to have a live coding example via Gmeet,we can conduct it,in any topic.
Hope this program was a help for you.




Hey all, today is our last task based on the scheduled tutorials. The task is to implement enqueue and dequeue operation using linked list in a queue.

What you have to do is that:
1. Create a queue
2. Enqueue elements into the queue defining enqueue() funtion
3.Dequeue elements defining a dequeue() function. 

Take your time and complete all the task, after this we are planning a small coding competition in Hackerrank. We will provide the details soon. Subsequently we will announce those two people who have really able to Build The Basics..it would be based on those who have completed most of the tasks and performed well in the competition...so keep this in mind and do wellüòäüëç
