# Day 1


Hi all,

So let's start with the real basics. Today we have to go through Input-output operations, datatypes and variables. Take your time to go through the tutorials and make sure that you are clear with it.

Follow this order because one video is the continuation of the previous.
May be you are familiar with these syntax but watch it to get the reason behind each usage and let's follow the order of programming.
Send your queries here,and have a good start.




## Task

Hope all of you have gone through the videos that we have provided and hope now you are clear with those concepts and syntax. Now its time for you to try a small task...
       So here is your first task: take the details of a student as input and just print it. 
      
INPUT:
  
       Enter name : Abc
       Id: 244578
       Age : 20
       Address: abc house,street no 123
       Gender F/M: F
       Total Marks: 248.55

OUTPUT:
  
       Name : Abc
       Id: 244578
       Age : 20
       Address: abc house,street no 123
       Gender F/M: F
       Total Marks: 248.55

Save the code and attach the  screenshot of output in a doc and share the link to the SHE BOT as :  \task `link`
