Guys

As said yesterday,we won't have a tutorial or task today, instead use this day to understand linkedlist well and try doing the task.
And also try to finish all pending tasks so far.

Here is a small video on Doubly linked list.

This is not a part of our daily tutorial and so no task for it. Take a look at it if you are interested. Just to let you know that there are so many topics left out uncovered. 
Try exploring other than these tutorials if you feel interest in learning more on programing languages.
