Hi all..so let's discuss something interesting today. All of you may have heard and used conditional statements in C,like if else and all.

Conditional statements, as Google says ,help you to make a decision based on certain conditions. These conditions are specified by a set of conditional statements having boolean expressions which are evaluated to a boolean value true or false. It  helps us to decide whether a part of the program is to be executed or not by applying a condition.

We will be discussing different type of *if-else* statements today.
