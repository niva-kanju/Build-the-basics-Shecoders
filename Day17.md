# Day 17


Good morning all

Firstly ,Kudos to each who stick with us so far because we are moving towards the end of this basic building program. 3 more topics to cover. 
Today we will see one of the data structure in C, Linked list.

Prerequisites:
Before that , assure you are familiar with the following prerequisites

1. Typedef in C

- https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-use-the-typedef-struct-in-c#:~:text=The%20C%20language%20contains%20the,not%20create%20a%20new%20type

2. Pointer to structure

- https://overiq.com/c-programming-101/pointer-to-a-structure-in-c/

3. Dynamic memory allocation

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/

If you are not familiar with this, check out these links first and get a clear understanding

Then head over to the video below.This will give you a better idea on implementation of linkedlist

- https://youtu.be/VOpjAHCee7c

Go through the video slowly cos it is a little bit fast, pause and re-watch or decrease the playback speed if needed.

If you are so confused with the logic of linkedlist pause watching that and move to this one

Then go back and complete it.

And guys , pause and search if you feel unfamiliar with any topics in the video . Try to fill the gaps. Take your time .
Feel free to ask your doubts , datastructure is sometimes a confusing topic. So go ahead

## Task

Good morning all, Today we have moved into data structures, it has several application thus a clear cut understanding is mandatory . Go through the video twice or more to get a clarity of the concept and then attempt the task. 
Todays task is to -- insert a number at a particular position within a linkedlist--.All you have to do is that:

1. Create a linked list
2. Enter the position to insert and enter element also
3. Display the linkedlist

If you need any clarity you can approach us... Any sort of difficulty to do this , not clear with the algorithm we will help you with it.

Take your time to understand and do the code you can take tomorrow also , anyway we are not planning to give you new topic tomorrow . So drill in the same topic.
