Hi all
After one day gap, it is time for us to look at the next topic. Next , we will see another type of datastructure,ie Stack.
 
Stack Datastructure is similar to a real-world stack .
Without much delay let us see what exactly is stack,how it is implemented and what are the principle operations performed in it.
Here is your video lecture👇🏻

Understand the implementation well ,some of you already have it as a subject I think. So explore the topic completely and fill the gaps in between by searching or you can directly ask your doubts in the group.
