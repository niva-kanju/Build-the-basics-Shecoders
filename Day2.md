## Day 2

Good morning girls
Hope you've got a clear idea on yesterday's topics. Today onwards ,we will be discussing on operators in C.

An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific operators and produce final result.

Let's go through the following operations today

Watch these videos and ask if have any doubts :)

#### Task

Seems you guys got a clearcut idea of operators in C.
Time to do a simple task
Take 2 numbers as input and perform all the basic arithmetic operations.

  INPUT:

  Enter 2 numbers: 4
  2

  OUTPUT:

  4 + 2= 6
  4-2 = 2
  4*2 = 8
  4/2 = 2
  4%2 =0

Happy coding :)
